Lets tackle a very interesting extension of a basic problem . 

Question : Find the last non zero digit[LNZD from now on]in N! [Fatorial of N] ? 

Thought Process : 

1. Factorial the very big numbers . It makes sense not to ask the number and just one digit . 
2. We can easily find the last digit by taking mod by 10 . In general sense , to get last N digits 
   we take modulus by 10^N . 
3. But this problem asks for the LNZD and not the last digit . we will have to change our process . 

4. But we can establish that we will have to generate the factorial, although not save the entire result . 
   The following code comes naturally 

   int fact = 1;
   for(int i=1;i<=N;i++)
        fact *= i ;

5. Lets see what happenns when we run the loop
    1*1 = 1     = 1
    1*2 = 2     = 2
    2*3 = 6     = 6
    6*4 = 24    = 4
    24*5 = 120  = 2
    120*6 = 720 = 2

6. We begin to notice the logic when factorial comes out to be in double digit or more . 
   4! = 24 
   LNZD(4!) = LNZD(24) = 4
   Now see how we get the LNZD(5!) 
   LNZD(5!) = LNZD( LNZD(4!)*5 ) = LNZD( 4*5 ) = LNZD(20) = 2
   You can test it mathematically and convince yourself that it is true . 
   
7. For most of you , an easy iterative solution would be obvious at this point .
   For others , here is the pseudo code
    int LNZD = 1;
    for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){
        LNZD *= i ;
        LNZD  = getLNZD(LNZD);
    }

8. The getLNZD(int N) function has been left as an exercise for the viewer . 
9. If you can see , then you will realize that you can also model it recusively without any difficulty .
